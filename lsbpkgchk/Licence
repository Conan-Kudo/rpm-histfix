SCCS: @(#)Licence       1.8 (99/01/18) lsbpkgchk Test Suite

Preamble
--------

Testing is essential for proper development and maintenance
of standards-based products.

For buyers: adequate conformance testing leads to reduced integration
costs and protection of investments in applications, software and people.

For software developers: conformance testing of platforms and middleware
greatly reduces the cost of developing and maintaining multi-platform
application software.  

For suppliers: In-depth testing increases customer
satisfaction and keeps development and support costs in check. API
conformance is highly measurable and suppliers who claim it must be able
to substantiate that claim.
